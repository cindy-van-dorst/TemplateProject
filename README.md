Simple react-native template app for use with mobx

While trying to get a grip on mobx (in combination with react native) I ran 
into a lot of examples but a lot of them 'mixed in' something else.
This project just requires react-native and mobx.

To run the app
- Download the source
- Run npm install
- Run (on a mac) with react-native run-ios
